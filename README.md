# Yoga-Pose-Estimation-using-3D-CNN
This work was done as part of my final year project for my MSc coursework.
Applied different methodologies to estimate the Yoga Pose performed by the practitioner.
Performed Yoga Pose Estimation using two different architectures, namely C3D Architecture and MoViNet Architecture.

## C3D Architecture:
1. Popular for video analysis on Human Action Recognition tasks
2. Uses 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Conv3D Layers
  * MaxPool3D Layers
  * AvgPool3D Layers
3. Uses 3-D Kernels to perform Convolution

### Pre-processing Pipeline
1. Packages Used
  * OpenCV
  * MoviePy
  * FFmpeg
2. Pre-processings performed
3. Subclips
4. Augmentation Strategies Used !!
